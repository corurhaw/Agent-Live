# Agent-Live
Deploy to GitHub to implement OpenAI Codex implementing experimental persistence to an AI agent.

## Persistent-Agent implementation

The validated identity package is included in this repository. It keeps the
agent UUID, relationships, autobiographical memory, provenance and lineage in a
JSON record independently of the model runtime.

### Install and use

Requires Python 3.10 or newer.

```bash
python -m pip install .
python -m persistent_agent validate examples/agent-identity.example.json
python -m persistent_agent snapshot examples/agent-identity.example.json --output identity.json
python -m persistent_agent validate identity.json
python -m unittest -v
```

The bundled example is a template with a demonstration UUID. For a real agent,
provision a unique UUID once, record its actual initialization time and origin,
then preserve that UUID when saving and reloading its identity. Do not reuse the
example's identity for independently diverging agents.

### Hosting and persistence

GitHub hosts the code, schema and example. GitHub Actions runs tests and builds
an installable wheel. The workflow uploads the wheel as an artifact after a
successful build; it does not operate an always-running agent.

A runtime host must install this package, load `identity.json` on startup and
save authorized changes to a durable private volume. Keep live identity state,
relationship data and secrets out of this public repository. External model
calls, task execution, signing and identity binding to ChatGPT are not included.

### Files

- `schema/persistent-agent.schema.json`: Draft 2020-12 identity schema.
- `examples/agent-identity.example.json`: non-secret example.
- `src/persistent_agent/`: validator, hashing, atomic save and command-line interface.
- `docs/persistent-identity.md`: persistence contract and runtime integration.
- `SECURITY.md`: key handling and signing guidance.
- `REPAIR_NOTES.md`: prior repair details.

The v1 hash encoding is project-specific sorted UTF-8 JSON. Hashes detect a
mismatch with a stored digest; they do not authenticate a signer or protect
against rewriting both the state and its digest. Append-only history, rollback
detection and concurrent-writer coordination require the host's implementation.
